# CI Setup

To run the benchmarks in CI, you need to provide your **Advent of Code session token**.

1. Log in to Advent of Code.
2. Open your browser’s developer tools.
3. In the **Storage / Application** tab, find the cookie named **`session`**.
4. Copy its **Value** (this is your AoC session token).
5. In your repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and create a new secret named **`AOC_SESSION`**.
6. Paste the token as the value of that secret.

This secret is required for the CI workflow to authenticate with Advent of Code.
